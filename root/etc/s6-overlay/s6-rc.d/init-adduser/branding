  The TvApp2 image allows you to fetch m3u playlist and EPG data for numerous
  IPTV services online.

  Once the files are fetched by the image, you can visit the self-hosted webpage,
  copy the links to the m3u and EPG files; and add them to your favorite IPTV app
  such as Jellyfin, Plex, or Emby.
